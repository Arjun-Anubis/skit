Good morning everyone. We hope you are enjoying the Hamara Manch so far. We are here to present to you a skit about dreams. The skit is about a boy named Ishaan who wants to be a v-tuber, but faces a lot of difficulties while pursuing his dream.
Here is a brief introduction to the characters and who is acting them:
Ambuj is Ishaan for the first act, the motivational subscriber, and one of Ishaan's friends. Dhairya is Ishaan for the second and third act, and the uncle from the neighbouring house. Ayush is Ishaan for the fourth act, the teacher in the exam hall, and another friend of Ishaan. Nayneka is Ishaan's mother. Kavin is Ishaan's father.
We hope you enjoy it.
