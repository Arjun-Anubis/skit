Act 1

Scene 1, Discovery

Charachters: mc

Part 1:

Setting: mc's bedroom

_mc walks into the room, clearly exhausted and sad, walks up to the couch/bed and falls onto it
Gets his head out of the pillow and looks blankly at the window, we give the audience the oppurtunity to understand the situation
Reaches into his pocket and takes out his phone, camera closes up on the phone._
<!-->

Possibly after being bullied on social media

<-->
_The camera now moves to the back of the mc, giving the audience a good look at what he's doing
Camera advances further letting us look at just the phone in his hands, revealing a marksheet with red marking on the bed
Scrolls through youtube dejected, not stopping at anything for very long, we see many videos go by
Comes to mr. sneax's video, he's about to scroll past, but taps it by mistake
Sighs, he's too lazy to go back, falls back, phone up in his hands
As the video goes on, he perks up little by little, till he is sitting up_

*The video ends*
*mc gets up, walks to his desk*

Part 2:
