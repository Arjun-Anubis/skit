Act 1

Scene 3, The first struggle

Setting: Bedroom

_The camera opens to the mc, recording for his video. We see a sheet stuck on the wall saying the exams start next week_

Mother (From outside the door): Beta, exams ke tayyaari kaisi chal rahi hai?

mc (Distracted): Hmmmmmmmmmmm!

*Mother opens the door*

Mother (Sarcastic): Padhai ho gayi beta?

mc ( Still hasnt realized that Mother has opened the door and is watching him ): Hmmmmm!

*Mother unpluds the pc
Mother: Padhai kar lo beta! Agle hafte exams aa rahe hain! Poora din khelte hi rehte ho! Exams aa rahe hain tab bhi padhai nahi kar rahe! 	  Aankhe kharab ho jaaenge. Dimag toh pehle se hi kharab hai.

Mc: Aapko computer ke baare mein kuchh nahi pata. Aap to mat hi bolo. Apna mooh band kar lo.

_She slaps him_

Mother: Abhi padhai karna shuroo karo. Poori raat padhna. Varna kumpooter le loongi!

_She exits the room and slams the door_
